			<h2>Rare bobolink birds make Couch Hill Preserve an Audubon site</h2>
			<p>from <a href="http://www.thereddingpilot.com/2016/06/10/rare-bobolink-birds-make-couch-hill-preserve-an-audubon-site/">The Redding Pilot</a></p>
			<p>Reddingâ€™s Couch Hill Preserve off Sunset Hill Road is beloved by more than those of us who have enjoyed its open spaces and sweeping vistas to eastern distant hills.  Every spring, endangered songbirds, the spectacular Bobolink, migrate over 6,000 miles from the pampas of Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil to the grassy fields of Couch Hill.</p>
			<p>In early May, the male Bobolinks arrive and start their territorial aerial displays, using fluttery wingbeats and warbling songs. Several males will often engage in display flights at the same time.</p>
			<p>Their breeding plumage is a striking combination of black, white and yellow. By contrast, the females, who arrive later in the month, are a streaky brownish-yellow, almost invisible in the fields where they make circular nests deep in the grass.</p>

<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	It is useful to organize the code, and to make it easier to read for other coders and people with disabilities. I would think that main would be one of the most useful because it is the reason people go on the page. 
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	It usually goes from top to bottom. 
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	Sublime is a bigger tool than I expected. I think i will create snippets when I come across more projects and realize what kind of snippets I need. 
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	Snippets were the most difficult trying to figure out and also when to use which semantic tag, but I think using both snippets and semantic tags will improve my understanding of them.
