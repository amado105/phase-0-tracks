			<h2>Rare bobolink birds make Couch Hill Preserve an Audubon site</h2>
			<p>from <a href="http://www.thereddingpilot.com/2016/06/10/rare-bobolink-birds-make-couch-hill-preserve-an-audubon-site/">The Redding Pilot</a></p>
			<p>Redding’s Couch Hill Preserve off Sunset Hill Road is beloved by more than those of us who have enjoyed its open spaces and sweeping vistas to eastern distant hills.  Every spring, endangered songbirds, the spectacular Bobolink, migrate over 6,000 miles from the pampas of Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil to the grassy fields of Couch Hill.</p>
			<p>In early May, the male Bobolinks arrive and start their territorial aerial displays, using fluttery wingbeats and warbling songs. Several males will often engage in display flights at the same time.</p>
			<p>Their breeding plumage is a striking combination of black, white and yellow. By contrast, the females, who arrive later in the month, are a streaky brownish-yellow, almost invisible in the fields where they make circular nests deep in the grass.</p>
