# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Verion control is a way to save and access different versions of a file or folder. It is useful because it creates a safety net in case something happenes to your version on your local computer or something happens to your actual computer. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a subversion or extension of a file used to manipulate the information on that branch without affecting the default branch, called the master. It is useful for two major reasons: first, allows mulitple people to work together from the same master branch, and second, mistakes made will not affect the original data. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a saved version of a file. In other words, one commits a file to make a record of the version at that moment. A good commit message is very decriptive and easily read by others. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when trying to merge various branches with different code and the computer cannot merge them.
