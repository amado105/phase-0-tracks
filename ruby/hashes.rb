# Create all the questions and then take the responses and convert them to 
#  the approptirate data 



# create the hash and create the symbols as keys, and put the variables 
# containing responses as the value 

# Ask if they want to update any information once, if yes then continue on to 
# ask which key they would like to updated, and then ask what they would like to 
#  change it to. if the key-value pair takes an integer as a value, 
# convert the user input into an integer then update the key-value pair.
